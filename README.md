An short application to get information from GitHub's API. 



Here, you can type a repository's name (following the template -  "userName/repositoryName"), and the program will return:
- the avatar of the repository's user;
- the repository's name;
- the description; 
- a link to access the repository on GitHub's website.

A loading indicator appears on the screen showing the loading status;

An error message appears also appears whether an error on repository retrieval occurs.



That program was based on the beginner Rocketseat's course to learn the basic functionalities of JavaScript and ES6 +.
